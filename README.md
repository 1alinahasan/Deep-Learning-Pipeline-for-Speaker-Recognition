# VoxCeleb Speech Modeling Pipeline

This project focuses on building a PyTorch-based data pipeline for speech and speaker modeling using the VoxCeleb dataset.

The current stage of the project includes:
- Loading and organizing VoxCeleb audio data
- Speaker-aware train, validation, and test splits
- Fixed-length audio normalization (padding and random cropping)
- Gender-balanced sampling for training
- Optional mel-spectrogram feature extraction

🚧 **Status: Ongoing**  
Neural network models for speech and speaker representation learning will be added in the next assignment.

This repository is being developed incrementally as part of a course project.
